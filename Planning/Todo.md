# TODO

-   [] Remove the replace for local go mod repo.
-   [x] Info needs to display info about the hash table.
-   [x] Scan needs to output some verbose info.
-   [x] Scan needs to output progress info.
-   [] Export needs verbose info
-   [] Resume needs verbose info
-   [] Could do with more testing on failure paths
-   [] verbose and progress is a bit crazy. Perhaps when using progress, then don't output each file being hashed.
-   [] Add elapsed time when using verbose
-   [] Add a flag for printing out memory usage.
-   [] Export, Diff and ToSync need to support -f --full paths.
